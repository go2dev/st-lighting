This is the video player program.

The video must be called 0.mov and it has to be in the data folder inside this folder.

The white grid of sample dots will only appear if there is a fadecandy plugged in and you have run the fcserver program before you run this program.

Open meltplayer.pde in Processing 3 and then press the [>] play button to make the program run.

If it fails to run, there will be an error message at the bottom of the processing programming window with some helpful info in it.

Videos will play on a loop but there may well be a short and non uniform delay at the start/stop loop point; don't rely on the playback system for accurate timing.

Pressing 'p' will pause/unpause the currently playing file
Pressing 'r' will reset the currently playing file back to time=0 and start playing it again
