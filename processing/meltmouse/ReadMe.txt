This is the image mouse move program

The image must be called dot.png and it has to be in the data folder inside this folder.

The white grid of sample dots will only appear if there is a fadecandy plugged in and you have run the fcserver program before you run this program.

Open meltmouse.pde in Processing 3 and then press the [>] play button to make the program run.

If it fails to run, there will be an error message at the bottom of the processing programming window with some helpful info in it.

Whatever image is loaded as dot.png will appear where the mouse is and you can move it around in real time.

Change the image to get different colours/effects. Remember RGB-0/0/0 (black) is off and RGB-255/255/255 (white) is fully on max brightness. Thus grey is white with a lesser brightness etc.

Press p to toggle the image on and off while the program is running
